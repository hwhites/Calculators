      <p>
        calcCollection was founded on a simple principle: everyone deserves access to high-quality, easy-to-use digital tools without the frustration of subscriptions, sign-ups, or intrusive ads. We saw a need for a central place where students, professionals, and curious individuals could find reliable calculators and converters that just work.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-12">Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Our goal is to build a comprehensive suite of calculators that are fast, accurate, and completely free. Whether you're a student trying to calculate your GPA, a homeowner planning a project, or a professional tracking work hours, our tools are designed to give you the answers you need quickly and efficiently.
